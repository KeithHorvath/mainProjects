            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <h5>(Our Sandwiches)</h5>
            
            <p>We're co-owners Ray (and Ray). We've been friends since high school, but our sandwich journey started with the desire
                to see how many things could be turned into a sandwich, and it evolved from there. Eventually, after having too many
                poor-quality sandwiches, we branched out and introduced ourselves to local farmers so we could source everything as
                close to farm-to-table as possible.</p>
            
            <p>One day we were having a neighborhood party, and everyone was obsessed with our sandwiches. They wanted to know where
                we got our ingredients because of how good everything was. We knew we had something special, so we decided to open
                our own sandwich shop.</p>
            
            <p>Today we work with nearly a dozen farmers who specialize in their fields, be it turkey and pork or leafy greens and
                tomatoes. Our ingredients are the freshest you'll find anywhere, and you'll recognize this from your first bite.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for coming to our humble sandwich shop. We hope you have the most delicious sandwich you've ever had.</p>
